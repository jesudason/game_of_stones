#Game of Stones

I learnt this game in the jungle of Phong Nga, Vietnam. It was a favourite among the locals. After showing friends in Australia and having them become obsessed with it, I thought it would make a fun project to build as I learn to code.

##How to play:

Two players or play against the computer

* Stones are set out in three rows, of 3, 4 and 5 stones.
* Players take turns at removing stones. You may take as many stones as you like from one row only. In each turn you can choose which row to select from.
* The goal is to not take the last stone. The player left with the last stone loses.
