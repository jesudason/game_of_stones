<h1>Game of Stones</h1>

I learnt this game in the jungle of Phong Nga, Vietnam. It was a favourite among the locals. After showing friends in Australia and having them become obsessed with it, I thought it would make a fun project to build as I learn to code.

<h2>How to play:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Two player game, or play against the computer</li>
  <li>Stones are set out in three rows, of 3, 4 and 5 stones.</li>
  <li>Players take turns at removing stones. You may take as many stones as you like from one row only. In each turn you can choose which row to select from.</li>
  <li>The goal is to not take the last stone. The player left with the last stone loses.</li>
</ul>
